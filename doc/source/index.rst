Welcome to python-startkladde's documentation!
==============================================
Python startkladde is a python interface to the
`Startkladde <http://startkladde.sourceforge.net/>`_ database. It is intended as
a maintenance tool for admins who have to maintain either the Startkladde
Database and/or the associated web interface.

The python interface consists of a package called skpy and a set of executable
tools, which provide the functionality implemented in the package from the
command line.

:doc:`modules/pysk` contains several sub-packages, which group the different
python modules by their respective functionality.
