Modules
=======
Almost all functionality provided by Python Startkladde is implemented in several
modules. These modules are distributed over several packages for different
purposes.

All modules are summarised in the main package called :py:mod:`pysk` (for python
startkladde). This module contains the following sub-modules:

* :doc:`db/db` for database operations
* :doc:`tools/tools` which contains the implementation of most command line tools
* :doc:`utils/utils`
