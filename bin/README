These scripts are intended to synchronise the startkladde laptop used to run
startkladde (client) with a web-server (the server) running the startkladde web
interface.

The client is assumed to have two accounts:
 - flight
 - admin (not the same as root)

The mysql database on the client has two accounts:
- startkladde is the functional account used by the startkladde program
- backup has some additional rights needed to perform backup operations
  on the database. The scripts should be run as user backup
 
The server is assumed to have an account sync.

The flight account is intended as general access acount which is used to run
startkladde. Since this account is basically open to the public, the rights
of this account should be restricted to a minimum. It should e.g. not have read
access to any scripts containing passwords in clear text or any sensitive ssh
key files.

The admin account is the owner of all scripts for sync and should have more
rights in terms of database administration.

The backup process runs as follows:
- flight calls the startkladde_sync_client script. Since the script belongs to
  admin, the right to execute this script as admin must be granted to flight
  using visudo

- The startkladde_backup script is run by admin to create a backup file, which
  is transferred to the server using scp. Scp performs password-less login on
  the server using RSA. For this to work a public / private key pair has to
  exist in /home/admin/.ssh. The public key id_rsa.pub must be made availabe to
  the server.
  
- The server must be configured to allow password-less login via ssh. This
  requires to add the public key of the client to
  /home/sync/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server. The respective line in
  authorized_keys should have the form (without any newlines):
    command="<path to startkladde_sync_server.sh>",no-port-forwarding,
    no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty,<pub-key> 
  This automatically executes the sync_server script and exits and thus permits
  minimal possibilities for attackers.
  
- The sync_server script copies the backup file using scp, performs a backup of
  the current database using startkladde_backup and then restores the database
  using startkladde_restore with the backup file copied from the client.
